## 🎬 TikTok Viral Strategy

### Content Pillars (Post 3x/day)

#### 1. Transformation Content
**Formula**: "Before AI vs After AI"
- Messy closet → Organized wardrobe
- "Nothing to wear" → 3 perfect outfits
- 5 min getting ready → 30 seconds with AI suggestions

**Example Script**:
```
[Fast transition]
Before StyleSnap: *chaos, stressed, late*
After StyleSnap: *outfit ready, confident, on time*
Caption: "AI changed my morning routine"
```

**Hooks**:
- "POV: You have 100 clothes but nothing to wear..."
- "Watch AI organize my entire wardrobe in 5 minutes"
- "I let AI style me for a week..."

#### 2. Tutorial/Value Content
**Formula**: "How to X with StyleSnap"
- How to build a capsule wardrobe with AI
- How AI finds missing pieces in your wardrobe
- How to never repeat outfits

**Example**:
```
"3 ways to use AI for your wardrobe:
1. Scan everything with your camera
2. Get daily outfit suggestions
3. Find what you're missing
Link in bio! 👆"
```

#### 3. Lifestyle/Aspirational
**Formula**: Show dream lifestyle enabled by app
- "Get ready with me (AI edition)"
- "Outfit of the day (AI picked)"
- "Week of outfits planned by AI"

**Example**:
```
[Outfit montage]
"AI picked my outfits for Paris Fashion Week
Day 1: [outfit]
Day 2: [outfit]
Day 3: [outfit]
App: StyleSnap 📱"
```

#### 4. Humor/Relatable
**Formula**: Fashion problems → AI solutions
- "When AI knows you better than your 마"
- "AI roasting my outfit choices"
- "Me vs AI fashion battle"

### Viral Tactics

**Participate in Trends**:
- Use trending sounds
- Adapt trending formats (e.g., "hear me out" cake)
- Fashion angle on popular memes

**Collaborate**:

**Challenges**:

- UGC: Encourage users to post their AI outfits

**Timing**:

- Align with fashion events (Fashion Week, award shows)

**Optimization**:
- First 3 seconds hook
- On-screen text for sound-off viewers
- Clear CTA in caption ("Link in bio", "Get the app")
- Always add link in bio

**Target**: 1M views per  week by month 2
